This repository contains all code used for trials, experimentation and eventually used in the paper: Megahed, F. M., Wells, L. J., Camelio, J. A., &amp; Woodall, W. H. (2012). A spatiotemporal method for the monitoring of image data. Quality and Reliability Engineering International, 28(8), 967-980. The code has not been touched since 2010 and I have shared it with 8-10 research groups since the paper was published. This repo is somewhat disorganized as it is purely a file dump of everything we tried for the paper.
